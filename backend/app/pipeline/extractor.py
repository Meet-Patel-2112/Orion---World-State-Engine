"""
Extract a chapter with the extraction pipeline (../extractor, docs/wse_extraction_plan.md) and hand the
integration the plain dict it accepts (entities by name with their facts, relationships, events).

The pipeline runs in its own Python 3.12 venv with torch and the GPU, so it is called as a subprocess
(`python -m extractor run IN.txt OUT.json`) and returns an orion_gold_v1 document. It resolves mentions and
coreference within the chapter; entities join earlier chapters by name and alias (WorldStateService).
