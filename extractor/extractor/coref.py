"""
Phase 3 — coreference and pronouns, over the whole story (long-range context matters).

BookNLP (trained on fiction) returns clusters of character spans; chosen over Maverick and FCoref on the 4 gold
stories (docs/wse_extraction_plan.md, Phase 3). `link` maps them onto the document:
    - a span overlapping a Phase 2 mention becomes that mention (1:1, largest overlap first: the scorer's `align`)
    - an unmatched span whose head word is a pronoun becomes a new `pronominal` mention, typed from its cluster;
      a cluster of pronouns only is a character when personal ("I ... me ... my": the narrator), skipped when it has
      only "it"-like pronouns (nothing to type it by)
    - an unmatched proper name in a cluster with a matched mention becomes a new `proper` mention ("Mara" after
      "Mara Quinn": mention detection often finds only the full name, and "Mara's brother" needs "Mara")
    - other unmatched spans are ignored: mention detection is Phase 2's job (adding them lowered its scores)
Then `merge` joins repeats of the same name that the model split or left unclustered, and names introduced as
"my / his / her ... name is X" (the model misses these: the narrator's "I" was never linked to "Evelyn").
